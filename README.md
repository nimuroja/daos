# DaOs Discord Bot
This is a pseudo-casino dealer bot that uses the text channels in a Discord server to play blackjack or poker with your friends. The bot can start a game of blackjack or poker with 2 players. Use the command '$help' to get started. This bot by Daniel Wandeler and Oscar Santiago is our final project submission for CS3080 Fall 2020 at UCCS.
